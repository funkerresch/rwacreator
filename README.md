Desktop Application for Real World Audio (RWA)

Around 2015 I started with the development of the Real World Audio (RWA) environment. RWA is a middleware for creating interactive binaural soundwalks. It includes a Desktop "Creator" Software, an iOS client and a ESP32-based head tracking device for dynamic binaural synthesis. The RWA Creator is a cross-platform application written in C++/Qt and can be extended with Pure Data patches. Besides location-based audio playback it facilitates mechanisms for implementing more complex game logic without the need for writing code. Once audio files, Pd patches and other assets are placed on the map, the corresponding RWA game can be exported to the iOS client.
